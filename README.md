# dev-love-sobie

This project is a redesigned and modernized <i>About</i> section and <i>Homepage</i> for the <b>Society of Business</b>, <b>Industry</b>, and <b>Economics</b> (SOBIE) website. The goal was to create a clean, accessible, and visually engaging experience that highlights SOBIE’s mission, history, and academic journal, JOBIE, while also improving usability for visitors.

The site features a card-based layout styled with custom CSS, incorporating SOBIE’s brand colors navy and gold for visual consistency. Section dividers, hover effects, and structured content help guide the user experience.

These updates were designed with clarity, accessibility, and professional presentation in mind, making them ideal for prospective conference attendees, academic researchers, and first-time visitors alike. 👏
